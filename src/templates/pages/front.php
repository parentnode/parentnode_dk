	<h1>You have to start somewhere ...</h1>
	<p>
		On the first day there was HTML.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without HTML and frontend development the Internet would be a lot less interesting. The visual user 
		interface is the primary reason for webdevelopment, today more than ever. It is in the nature of the Internet to 
		facilitate interaction bewteen clients and servers, businesses and customers or even nations and citizens.
	</p>
	<p>
		Technology should make life easier. Webtechnology should be centered on enabling frontend development,
		because that is where technology meets people, and at the end of the day - if not for us, the people,
		then for what?
	</p>
	<p>
		A lot of things aren't exactly what they should be and some people use that as an excuse to
		to accept pretty bad as good enough. They just continue down the same old path, blindly ignoring
		all warnings in the comfort of old habit and minimal effort. But that is the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are here to shift that balance, by providing new webtechnologies, designed to perform and enable 
		frontend developers go even further. parentNode is founded on an idealistic dedication to frontend 
		centered technology. Because it is the only thing that makes sense when it comes to web
		development.
