	<h1>You have to start somewhere ...</h1>
	<p>
		On the first day there was HTML.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without HTML and frontend development the Internet would be a lot less interesting. The visual user 
		interface is the primary reason for webdevelopment, today more than ever. It is in the nature of the Internet to 
		facilitate interaction bewteen clients and servers, businesses and customers or nations and citizens.
	</p>
	<p>
		Technology should make life easier and webtechnology should be centered on enabling frontend development,
		but a lot of things aren't exactly what they should be. We are here to shift that balance, by providing
		new webtechnologies, designed to perform and enable frontend developers go even further.
	</p>
	<p>
		parentNode is founded on an idealistic dedication to frontend 
		centered technology. Because it is the only thing that makes sense.
