				Perfect is an illusion. We all have our own idea of perfect, reflecting our own priorities,
				needs and desires. More often than not we are forced to accept a level far below our own idea of
				perfection. To me that is deeply depressing and this is my compensation.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my persuit of perfection I have built a full stack platform for web development. Always
				prioritizing frontend development and content accissibility, while keeping complexity low and 
				flexibility high. With no compromises because I never had a deadline.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am this stubborn because I love coding and hate restrictions. Everything is open source and
				forkable on GitHub. Try it out on your next project.
