				In an effort to ensure that creativity, quality and ambition is prioritized over spreadsheet logic 
				I have formulated the following development guidelines, challenging traditional
				business models where the majority of decisions are made purely to maximize profit.
			</p> 
			<p>
				These statements are meant to be disruptive. Don't do it all at once.
			</p>

			<ul class="manifest">
				<li>
					<h3>The primary objective is the end user</h3>
					<p>
						Forget about money - it corrupts everything and despite what they say money 
						doesn't care about innovation. Right.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Make it personal</h3>
					<p>
						You should care. Leverage your own interests. 
						What do you gain? Punch yourself hard in the face if you 
						just said <em>money</em>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Ignore cost of development</h3>
					<p>
						Favor making the right long term decisions. We can't keep wasting our time making 
						up for short term profit thinking.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Explore, philosophize, rationalize</h3>
					<p>
						Peek into the dark corners. Be philosophical. And then come up with an explanation. 
						In that order.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Be uncompromisingly ambitious</h3>
					<p>
						Think even bigger. Swim with the sharks. Drown a little each day. We need new ideas.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Build it three times</h3>
					<p>
						Something new will arise in the process, if nothing else you
						will get a pretty good idea about the cost of your own bad habits.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Forget about fitting in</h3>
					<p>
						It is a waste of time and energy. Sheep fit in. Are you a sheep? I didn't think so.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Meditate</h3>
					<p>
						Or smoke weed. Lower your brain frequency to lessen resistance. Let go for a 
						while to get a better grip.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Get lost in details</h3>
					<p>
						Take it all the way to the extreme. Out there on the edge there is a new 
						idea waiting to be discovered.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Restructure, refine, reimplement</h3>
					<p>
						Learn from new experiences. Deal with your past mistakes. Understanding will sink in.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Gain experience through insane experiments</h3>
					<p>
						Waste your time building something completely useless just for fun. You will learn
						something you didn't expect.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Never listen to guys/girls in suits</h3>
					<p>
						No comment needed.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Share everything</h3>
					<p>
						Sharing is selfish caring. You give, you get. It really is that simple. 
						(It doesn't work if you only share shit)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Feel free to curse</h3>
					<p>
						Be passionate. Consider it a spice. Just don't overdo it. 
						And remember to be polite now and then.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Do it anyway</h3>
					<p>
						So someone said you shouldn't do it? What the hell do they know. 
						It is likely they are just scared. Don't be scared.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Bring patience and expect hard work</h3>
					<p>
						Only with endurance will you prevail. Don't pretend everything is a piece of cake, but eat
						it as if it were.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Make yourself proud</h3>
					<p>
						Because in the end you are the one staring back from the mirror. If something makes you embassed,
						you should stop right now.
					</p>
				</li>
